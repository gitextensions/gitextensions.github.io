This repo contains the source for the Git Extensions website at http://gitextensions.github.io/.

The site is mostly a placeholder, more up to date info at https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions and more details at [online manual](https://git-extensions-documentation.readthedocs.org/)

The process to troubleshoot updates is TBD.
